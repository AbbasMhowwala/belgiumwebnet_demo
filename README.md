# Hi, I'm Abbas Mhowwala! 👋


## 🚀 About Me

I like to introduce myself as an experienced Front End Developer (UI Designer), dedicated to nurturing my creative talents and applying them to clients' work. I am passionate about my work and prefer to work as an independent with a passion for creating inspiring and influential designs.

I’ve designed the User-Experience and Interfaces for various influential Startups, who are now prospering as prominent Enterprises. I work closely with my Clients to design seamless interactive mobile and web applications.

The tools I use are Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma but I do believe in taking a traditional approach at times too and just stick to a paper and a pencil to design wireframes for prototyping. I feel like it's very important to test out the low fidelity mockups before moving on to them later.

I am very passionate about design and this is one of the core reasons for my close and emotional relationship with the clients I provide my services and value to.

Along with the design, I am also keen on Front End Development.

My Key expertise includes:

- W3C valid and semantic HTML 5 / CSS3
- Responsive Sites using media queries and Twitter Bootstrap
- PHP5 & MySQL
- jQuery, Ajax
- Wordpress (Theme and Plugin development)
- PSD2HTML
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JQuery
- Responsive Web Design
